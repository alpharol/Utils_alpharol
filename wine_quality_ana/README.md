# wine_quality_ana
This is a classical data for classification tasks. I use several methods to analysis it. You can find almost every method in this repo. 

The purpose is to analysis the wine quality. 

The data is stored in the "winequality-red.xlsx" and I do some explaination in the "wine 说明.xlsx".

I split the train and test in the "train_test_split.R"

All of the classification models are stored in the classification.
