# ass_srt

<br/>

In some online video player, only the srt file is supported. But most of the subtitle file is ass because it has better expression. So the aim of this project is to change the ass subtitle file into srt subtitle file.

<br/>

The subtitle of *Person of Interest* S03E01 is chosen to test.  And at this time, the code of the ass file and srt file is USC-2 LE BOM and ANSI respectively because we need to deal with chinese words. 

<br/>

If there are errors about this project, please send me the ass file.

If the subtitle of the srt file is not right, please send me the ass file and the wrong subtitle.
